# Head-Pose-Estimation

In this task, we want to know the Headâ€™s pose from its translation and rotation 

# * Objective
Train 3 supervised machine learning models to predict the 3 euler angles; Pitch, Yaw and roll and project them on frames and images.

* features: Face landmarks (left eye, right eye, nose, left mouth, right mouth and chin) 
* labels: Pitch, Yaw and roll

# * Dataset
Dataset consists of 2000 image of different faces with different poses.
